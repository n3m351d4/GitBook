# Internet of Things and Embedded Systems

[Introduction to the Internet of Things and Embedded Systems](https://telegra.ph/Introduction-to-the-Internet-of-Things-and-Embedded-Systems-spojlery-07-10)

## **Week 1.**&#x20;

#### Задача.

Identify and analyze a device which is an IoT device now, but was a non-IoT device in the past. Compare the functions of the device in the past to the functions of the device now. Enumerate any improvements, or any diminishments if they exist. Are there any limitations that are present in the new IoT version of the device? Are there privacy issues that never existed in the original version of the device?

#### Задача.

Identify two embedded systems which are sold on the market today and analyze their interfaces. Describe all inputs to each system and outputs from each system. Classify the inputs and outputs based on their mode of interaction:

* Visual - describing data carried by visible light
* Audio - describing data carried by sound
* Tactile - describing data carried by touch
* Electronic - describing data encoded in electrical signals

#### Задача.

1. Research two microcontrollers and provide information about them from their datasheets. There are several microcontroller manufacturers which you can investigate including Atmel, Microchip, Freescale, TI, etc. For each microcontroller, report the following information. (Be sure to include a link to an online reference where you found this information.) Clock frequency Bitwidth of the datapath Size of Flash memory Number of pins Does the microcontroller contain an Analog-to-Digital Converter? If so, how many bits of precision does it have?
2. Research the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms to determine if there are operating systems which can be used on each platform. If there are, list those operating systems and state whether they are open source or not.

#### Задача.

Download and install Wireshark on a computer. Start a web browser on your computer and start packet capture with Wireshark. Use your browser to go to the website of CNN ([https://www.cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com)). Stop packet capture with Wireshark. Using Wireshark, find the HTTP packet that was initially sent by your browser to the New York Times web server to request the page. Select that request message and create a screen dump (print screen) of Wireshark displaying the request. Save that screen dump and upload it here.
