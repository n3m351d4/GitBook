# Piracetam Changes your Personality

Veteran Biohackers (or those close to them) will admit that long term Piracetam usage does change your personality. Amongst the anecdotal reports, a lot of people report that it makes them more _cocky_ and egocentric. If you’re long been been the nice guy (or gal) that people disregarded Piracetam may inject a _quantum of psychopathy_ into your personality that makes you a bit more functional in a cynical, unfair world.\

> I’ve upped my dose to 24g per day since last night. The level of power is almost too much to bear…It is time to change the world. I will grip it with my own hands and squeeze it, tear it, turn it, pound it until it becomes my image. The eternities within the creation cycle will hear my voice. Death is coming soon but not just yet. I want more power until there is no end, and then I will turn it to use…It is almost time for me to become the tool of the silent voice and the hand of god. Being so close to the edge is frustrating. I must count the heartbeats. Timing, the timing is everything. A new game of chess, one that I will win no matter how the opponent moves. But for now I must wait. Patience…

> The shine behind my eyes continues to grow. I am becoming something else: a mirror of the active side of infinity. A very dangerous thing indeed.

> Last night I was smashing the skulls of cats. They didn’t put up much of a fight either. The night before I killed dozens of people and other creatures. For the first time they all lost to me. There was no fear, only the joy of reaping.
