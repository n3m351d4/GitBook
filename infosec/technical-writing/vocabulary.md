# How to choose vocabulary wisely

**The main idea behind creating a company or your own dictionary as well as texts based on it, is to avoid ambiguity, thus, here are the main rules of how to do that:**

\
1\. Stick to one in words with many meanings in all of your documentation ( which has to be stated in your company documentation or your own dictionary) and be consistent throughout the whole text.

E.g. follow (verb):\
1\. = come after\
2\. = obey\
1\. The idea that follows...  2. Follow the rules! = > Obey the rules!&#x20;

2\. Be consistent.﻿Inconsistency in terminology forces users and translators to figure out whether different words and actions mean the same thing, which leads to confusion . Using consistent terminology can also decrease translation and localization costs . Examples of inconsistent terminology include the following: ■ switch, toggle  ■ start, launch, boot ■ burn, copy

3\. Use the shortest word possible.Shorter words are more conversational, save space on screen, and are easier to scan . Plain words are often easier for non-native English speakers and can reduce translation and localization costs.

E.g. This section **also** shows you . . .   **In addition**, this section shows you . . . Digital cameras **use** tiny microchips . . . Digital cameras **utilize** tiny microchips . . .\
\
4\. Avoid needless complexity: ﻿e.g. functionality(n\*) - feature, facilitate(v\*\*) - cause, individualized( adj.\*\*\*) - individual, heretofore (adj.) - previous\
\
5\. If you must abbreviate, define the term in it's **first** occurence, and put abbreviations in parentheses:﻿ e.g. This API (Application Programming Interface) allows you to connect bots to our system.

6\. Italicize the first occurrence of unfamiliar terms and define them right away: ﻿e.g. The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last element added is the first element retrieved (last-in, first-out; LIFO).

7\. Never use two words when one will do:﻿ e.g. at the present time - at present, completely eliminate - eliminate. Some other operation might ( **conceivably** ) remove the object from the list.

8\. Avoid longer noun phrases, use verbs instead: ﻿e.g.  make an arrangement  - arrange, make a decision - decide.

9\. Do not try to be funny.Jokes, slang, and sarcasm are context-specific and hard to translate and localize . What’s funny to you might offend or alienate some portion of your audience, so it’s best to avoid these rhetorical approaches .\
\
10\. Use consistent spelling, American vs British, whatever you choose, just  stick to it. A little tip: AmE is a lot easier.For more detailed information on the subject, please,  click on the following link: [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/british-and-american-spelling](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/british-and-american-spelling)

11\. Don’t invent words or apply new meanings to standard words .Assume that users are more familiar with a word’s established meaning than with a special meaning given to it by the technology industry . When an industry term is required, provide an in-context definition. Avoid jargon, but remember that some expressions specific to computer use, such as hacker, are already part of everyday speech.

E.g.: Use a real verb like **categorize** or **group** . Don’t create a fake verb like bucketize from the noun bucket .

You can always look up in a reliable dictionary to check whether the word exists or not.
