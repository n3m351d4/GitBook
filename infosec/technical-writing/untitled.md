# What is technical writing?

'**Technical writing'** is any written form of writing or drafting [technical communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_communication) used in a variety of technical and occupational fields, such as [computer hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware) and [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering), [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry), [aeronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautics), [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics), [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance), [consumer electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics), and [biotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology). IT encompasses the largest sub-field within technical communication.

Technical writing is sometimes defined as _simplifying the complex_. A significant subset of the broader field of _technical communication_, **technical writing involves communicating complex information to those who need it to accomplish some task or goal.**

Some examples of technical writing include:

* Instruction manuals 
* Policy manuals 
* Process manuals 
* User manuals 
* Reports of analysis 
* Instructions for assembling a product 
* A summarization of a long report that highlights and shortens the most important element 

**Why do the companies as well as freelance software developers need to simplify their written language?**  
As companies worldwide increasingly need to deal with people speaking different languages, while products and processes become more and more complex, there is an evident need for clear and effective communication and documentation.  
**What are the main features of technical writing?** 

* brevity 
* clarity 
* simplicity 
* word choice \( restricted vocabulary\)
* grammar \( restricted rules\)
* organization of text and punctuation \(a set of rules\)

In other words, with technical writing nobody needs to be Dostoevskiy. It's even better to stop thinking in complex structures and ambiguous words at all. The main rule here is to think about the target audience, make it short, precise and clear for anybody to read. 

  
That's where Simplified Technical English \(STE\) comes in really handy. Since STE has been widely used in many industries, it has lead to its application in software development as well.  
**What is STE?**  
  
A clear unambiguous language for technical documents.  
**What are its direct or indirect benefits for companies and their employees?**  
It saves considerable translation costs representing an excellent basis for computer-aided or automated translation. Moreover, any specialist, e.g.  whose L1 \(first language\) is not English, will be able to understand the ideas behind it.  
**What is the basis of STE ?**  
English language, a  defined set  of grammar and syntax \( punctuation and text arrangement\) rules as well as restricted vocabulary are considered to be the foundations of STE.  
  
The focus of this course will be mainly grammar and the key syntax rules due to the fact that every company has its own dictionary. As the glossary varies from business to business, we cannot adequately estimate all the words necessary for each particular individual on the course. However, some basic concepts for the choice of appropriate vocabulary are to  be covered.
