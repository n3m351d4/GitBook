# Principles of Secure Coding

## Week 1

> Now, there are many different models for developing software. We won't go into them, other than to say, "For example, Agile is the one that's currently the most popular. It's a form of rapid prototyping. Waterfall model is a more traditional one. It's slower. From the security point of view, Waterfall model is probably the one that will give you the most assurance because you're doing a lot of reviews on the way. With Agile, the focus is getting it out the door quickly, and getting it the way the customer wants. Programs that are developed using Agile programming can be very secure,but typically, the security checking is done after the fact or at the very end whereas with the waterfall model and other many other models, you can build security and as you go along. But regardless of which model you use, of developments you use, underlying all this is the quality of code, the quality of the programming. When programmers program, they make assumptions. They make assumptions about input, output, environment, services they're going to use, and so forth. Herein lies the problem.

> This was so long ago, there was no law in the Netherlands against breaking into computers. So, when they called the Dutch Police, the Dutch police said, "Okay. Let's check him out. Not a spy. We're not interested. Go away." So, how did the police stop the student? United States law doesn't apply in the Netherlands. Every time they tried to block the student, they couldn't get in. The way they stopped him was apparently to, according to the story I heard, to a very junior police officer who just joined the force and was very new. He suggested calling the student's mother and asking her to tell him to stop it. That's exactly what they did and the attacks stopped the next day and never occurred again. But it's a non-technical solution to a technical problem.

> So, where do you find these assumptions? Well, when I was learning to do this stuff, a wonderful mentor, gentleman by the name of Robert Abbott, taught me to look in manuals. He was right. Because when you read the manuals, they'll often say things like can, must, should, will, ought, have to, things like that.
